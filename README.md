# Progress

1. the frontend(client) and the backend(server) are seperate repos vs 1 overall repo with 2 directories. I'm hoping this doesn't cause an issue.
1. set up socket.io package install on backend for the server, should also give id to each client that connects


1. http requests are okay, but slow
1. websockets (like socket.io) work in real time, like chatrooms and live updates

1. using JavaScript Mastery's youtube video on Socket.io to build the base. mostly just trying to follow and learn the pattern just because I don't understand how to make it work so far. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwFA3YMfkoc
